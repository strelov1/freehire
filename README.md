# freehire

[freehire.dev](https://freehire.dev) — open-source IT job aggregator backend. Many
source adapters feed a pipeline that normalizes postings into one schema,
deduplicates them, and enriches them with AI; everything is served over an HTTP
API with rich filters and full-text search. Fully open and transparent, designed
to make adding a new source a single entry in a config file.

## Stack

- **Go** + [Fiber v2](https://gofiber.io/) — HTTP server
- **PostgreSQL** — storage and filtering
- **[sqlc](https://sqlc.dev/)** — type-safe DB access from SQL (no ORM)
- **[Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/)** — full-text and faceted job search
- **[langchaingo](https://github.com/tmc/langchaingo)** — LLM access over any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (no vendor baked in)
- **Docker Compose** — local development

## Quick start

```bash
make up        # build + start app, postgres, and meilisearch in Docker
curl localhost:8080/health
curl localhost:8080/api/v1/jobs
```

Migrations are applied automatically on first Postgres volume init
(the `migrations/` folder is mounted into `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`).
Changing a migration does not re-apply to an existing volume — recreate it with
`docker compose down -v && make up`, or apply pending files manually with
`make migrate`.

If port 8080 is already taken, pick another host port:

```bash
HIRE_HOST_PORT=8090 make up
```

## Local development

```bash
docker compose up -d db   # database only
make run                  # server on host, reads DATABASE_URL
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust as needed. `JWT_SECRET` is required for
the server to start; OAuth and LLM credentials are optional (the features they
gate stay disabled when unset).

## Commands

```bash
make help      # list all commands
make sqlc      # regenerate code from SQL (via Docker, no local sqlc needed)
make tidy      # go mod tidy
make psql      # psql inside the DB container
make reindex   # rebuild the Meilisearch index from Postgres
make migrate   # apply migrations manually to an existing DB volume
```

## Workers

The server only serves the API. Ingest and enrichment are standalone, run-once
workers meant for cron — each crawls or drains its queue and exits.

```bash
go run ./cmd/ingest        # crawl the ATS boards in sources.yml and upsert jobs
go run ./cmd/enrich        # drain the enrichment queue (LLM); needs LLM_* config
go run ./cmd/tg-ingest     # crawl the Telegram channels in channels.yml
go run ./cmd/tg-extract    # LLM-extract vacancies from crawled Telegram posts
go run ./cmd/reindex       # rebuild the Meilisearch index from Postgres
go run ./cmd/backfill-geo  # backfill location-derived columns on existing jobs
```

## Layout

```

  sources/           ATS source adapters (greenhouse / lever / ashby) + registry
  linksource/        resolves outbound job links found in Telegram posts
  telegram/          Telegram-channel crawl + LLM vacancy extraction
  pipeline/          ingest runner (fetch → normalize → dedup → upsert)
  enrich/            typed AI-enrichment contract + queue-draining runner
  search/            Meilisearch indexing and query
  location/          geography parsed from free-text ATS location strings
  jobview/           the single public wire shape of a job
  normalize/         slug normalization
migrations/          SQL schema (source for both sqlc and initdb)
```

## API

All responses use `{"data": ...}` (single), `{"data": ..., "meta": {...}}`
(lists), or `{"error": msg}`. Jobs and companies are addressed by their public
slug.

## Adding a source

Adding a company is one entry in `sources.yml` (`company` + `provider` +
`board`). Adding an ATS platform is a new adapter in `internal/sources` plus one
line in `sources.All` — every adapter speaks the same `Source` interface, and
`cmd/ingest` validates the config against the registry before any crawl.

## Frontend

A Svelte SPA lives under `web/` and consumes the API (same-origin; a dev Vite
proxy forwards `/api` to the backend).

## Contributing

freehire's core is a small pipeline; the extension point is the **source**
(one entry in `sources.yml`, or a new adapter in `internal/sources`). New
contributors: open an issue first — issues and PRs from unapproved accounts are
auto-closed by default. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the workflow
and [AGENT.md](AGENT.md) for the architecture and conventions. Questions and
ideas go in [Discussions](https://github.com/strelov1/freehire/discussions).
