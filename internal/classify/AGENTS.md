# internal/classify — Seniority & Category Tagging

Deterministic seniority/category tagging from job title, feeding enrichment facets.

## Design

- Parses the **job title** at ingest into canonical `jobs.seniority`/`jobs.category` columns.
- Values from `vocab.SeniorityValues`/`vocab.CategoryValues` — EN+RU aliases, whole-word matched. Russian forms listed as full surface forms (not stems) since matcher requires word boundaries. **Never guesses**.
- Same alias→canonical dictionary design as `internal/location` and `internal/skilltag`.

## Grade-blind phrases

Some role names **contain** a grade word without stating a grade: "Member of Technical Staff" is a generic IC title, "Lead Generation" is a marketing function, "Middle East" is a region, "Mid-training" is a model-training stage. `gradeBlindPhrases` is cut from the title (each occurrence replaced by a space) **before** the seniority match, so only the remaining words can state a grade.

Ordering alone could not fix this: `staff` outranks `senior`, so "Senior Member of Technical Staff" resolved to `staff`. The mask leaves honest grades untouched — "Senior Staff Engineer" is still `staff`.

The list holds only phrases that shadow a `seniorityTable` alias; the category match reads the untouched title.

## The two design crafts

`design` means product/visual/experience design. Engineering draughting —
mechanical, electrical, civil, chip — is the separate `engineering_design`
category, a `vocab.NonTechCategories` member (surfaced as a facet, off the LLM and
embedding budgets). Its aliases, plus the markers that keep a title OUT of it
(`product design engineer`, `design systems engineer`, `network design engineer`),
are ordered **before** the bare `designer`/`design` entries — otherwise the word
`design` alone claims every "… Design Engineer". The unqualified `design engineer`
closes that block and resolves to `engineering_design`: on this catalogue that
population is overwhelmingly mechanical.

## Serving: dict-only

`jobview.FromRow` overwrites the nested `enrichment.seniority`/`enrichment.category` with the `jobs` column — the dictionary always wins, the LLM's value is never a fallback. They remain **nested under `enrichment`** so existing search facets, SPA, and generated contracts are unchanged.

## Convention

- Adding a value: add it to `vocab.SeniorityValues`/`vocab.CategoryValues` and the title-matching dictionary.
- Dictionary change needs `cmd/backfill-derive` + `cmd/reindex` to reach existing jobs (same caveat as geography/skills).
