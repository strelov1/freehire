## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The CV list re-opens sessions and has no create action

The CV list SHALL show the user's tailored CVs, each linking to its tailoring workspace
(`/tailor/[slug]?cv=<id>`, resume), and SHALL NOT offer a create action — a tailored CV is created
by opening the tailoring workspace for a vacancy (`/tailor/[slug]`), which bootstraps one if none
exists yet; there is no separate page to create it from. The list MUST carry the job slug and the
session id needed to build each re-open link.

#### Scenario: A list item re-opens its workspace

- **WHEN** the user clicks a tailored CV in the list
- **THEN** they land on that CV's tailoring workspace with its existing session

#### Scenario: There is no create button

- **WHEN** the user views the CV list
- **THEN** no "create CV" action is shown
