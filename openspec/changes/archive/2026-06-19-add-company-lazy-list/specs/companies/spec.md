## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Company list is served without joining jobs

The system SHALL expose `GET /api/v1/companies` returning companies read from the
`companies` table. Each company's job count SHALL be read from the denormalized
`companies.job_count` column (open jobs only), not computed at query time, so the
read path performs no join to the `jobs` table. The list SHALL be ordered by
`job_count` descending, then `name` ascending, so the most active companies
surface first.

The endpoint SHALL accept an optional `q` query parameter that filters companies
by a case-insensitive substring match on the company `name`. An absent or empty
`q` SHALL return the unfiltered list. When `q` is non-empty, the list `meta.total`
SHALL report the count of companies matching `q`, so pagination over the filtered
results is correct.

#### Scenario: Listing companies most-active first

- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /api/v1/companies`
- **THEN** the response contains companies under `data` with list `meta`,
  ordered by `job_count` descending (ties broken by `name`), each carrying its
  denormalized `job_count`

#### Scenario: Searching companies by name

- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /api/v1/companies?q=acme`
- **THEN** the response contains only companies whose name matches `acme`
  case-insensitively, ordered by `job_count` descending, and `meta.total` is the
  count of matching companies

#### Scenario: Empty query returns the full list

- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /api/v1/companies?q=` (empty or absent)
- **THEN** the response is the unfiltered company list, identical to omitting the
  parameter

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Company job counts are denormalized and periodically recomputed

The system SHALL store each company's count of open jobs (`closed_at IS NULL`) in
a denormalized `companies.job_count` column. The column SHALL be maintained by a
periodic recompute (a scheduled worker), not by a synchronous write on the job
ingest/close paths, so it is eventually consistent with the `jobs` table within
the recompute interval. A company with no open jobs SHALL have `job_count = 0`.

#### Scenario: Recompute reflects only open jobs

- **WHEN** the recompute runs and a company has 3 open jobs and 2 closed jobs
  (`closed_at` set)
- **THEN** that company's `job_count` is set to 3

#### Scenario: Recompute zeroes a company whose jobs all closed

- **WHEN** every job of a company has been closed since the last recompute and the
  recompute runs again
- **THEN** that company's `job_count` is set to 0

#### Scenario: Counts are eventually consistent

- **WHEN** a new job is ingested for a company between recompute runs
- **THEN** the company's `job_count` does not change until the next recompute,
  which then includes the new job
