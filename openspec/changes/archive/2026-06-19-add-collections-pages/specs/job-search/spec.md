## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Searchable jobs index

The system SHALL maintain a Meilisearch index of jobs with one document per job,
keyed by the job's internal `id`. Each document SHALL carry the fields needed to
both match and render a result without a follow-up database read: the searchable
text (title, company, description, location), the filterable facets, the
sortable fields, and the display fields returned to clients.

The index SHALL declare:
- **searchable attributes**: title, company, description, location.
- **filterable attributes**: source, company_slug, work_mode, employment_type,
  seniority, category, domains, regions, countries, company_type, company_size,
  visa_sponsorship, salary_currency, salary_period, skills, collections,
  salary_min, salary_max, experience_years_min. The raw `remote` flag SHALL NOT be
  a filterable attribute (work_mode subsumes it).
- **sortable attributes**: posted_at, salary_min, salary_max.

The document SHALL carry a top-level `collections` field: the set of curated
collection slugs the job's company belongs to, denormalized from the company onto
the job. It is a deterministic source fact (not derived from the job's text or
enrichment); a job whose company has no collections SHALL carry an empty
`collections` set. `collections` SHALL be a filterable facet and the corresponding
query parameter SHALL filter the feed.

Geography and work mode are filtered through the document's **top-level**
`regions`, `countries`, and `work_mode` fields — the resolved union/precedence of
the location-derived columns and the enrichment-derived values — not through the
`enrichment.*` dot paths. There SHALL be no separate
`enrichment.regions`/`enrichment.countries`/`enrichment.work_mode` facet on the
document.

Facets derived from a job's `enrichment` JSONB SHALL be absent (or empty) on the
document when the job is not yet enriched; an unenriched job SHALL still be
indexed and findable by its text fields, and SHALL still carry any geography
parsed from its location.

#### Scenario: A job is represented as one searchable document

- **WHEN** a job with title "Senior Go Developer", company "Acme", and a
  description is indexed
- **THEN** the `jobs` index holds one document keyed by that job's `id` whose
  searchable text includes the title, company, and description

#### Scenario: Unenriched job is still indexed with its parsed geography

- **WHEN** a job with no enrichment but location `Remote - USA` is indexed
- **THEN** the document is present and matchable by its text, with its
  enrichment-derived facets absent or empty and its top-level `regions`/
  `countries` carrying the parsed geography

#### Scenario: Geography is filterable via the top-level regions facet

- **WHEN** a job whose unioned geography includes `eu` is indexed
- **THEN** it is returned by a filter on `regions = "eu"`

#### Scenario: Collections are filterable via the collections facet

- **WHEN** a job whose company belongs to collection `yc` is indexed
- **THEN** it is returned by a filter on `collections = "yc"`, and a search
  faceted on `collections` reports its count under `yc`
