## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Searchable jobs index

The system SHALL maintain a Meilisearch index of jobs with one document per job,
keyed by the job's internal `id`. Each document SHALL carry the fields needed to
both match and render a result without a follow-up database read: the searchable
text (title, company, description, location), the filterable facets, the
sortable fields, and the display fields returned to clients.

The index SHALL declare:
- **searchable attributes**: title, company, description, location.
- **filterable attributes**: source, company_slug, work_mode, employment_type,
  seniority, category, domains, regions, countries, company_type, company_size,
  visa_sponsorship, salary_currency, salary_period, skills, salary_min,
  salary_max, experience_years_min, and `posted_ts`. The raw `remote` flag SHALL
  NOT be a filterable attribute (work_mode subsumes it).
- **sortable attributes**: posted_at, salary_min, salary_max.

Each document SHALL carry a derived numeric `posted_ts` field: the unix-seconds
value of the job's **effective** posting date — the source's `posted_at` when
present and not in the future, otherwise the ingest time (`created_at`) — the
same value, in epoch form, that the document's display `posted_at` reflects.
`posted_ts` is an index-only field: it SHALL be filterable but SHALL NOT appear
in the public job wire shape returned by the job read endpoints. Because
`posted_ts` is derived at index time, no Postgres column or backfill is
required; a reindex SHALL populate it on existing jobs.

Geography and work mode are filtered through the document's **top-level**
`regions`, `countries`, and `work_mode` fields — the resolved union/precedence of
the location-derived columns and the enrichment-derived values — not through the
`enrichment.*` dot paths. There SHALL be no separate
`enrichment.regions`/`enrichment.countries`/`enrichment.work_mode` facet on the
document.

Facets derived from a job's `enrichment` JSONB SHALL be absent (or empty) on the
document when the job is not yet enriched; an unenriched job SHALL still be
indexed and findable by its text fields, and SHALL still carry any geography
parsed from its location.

#### Scenario: A job is represented as one searchable document

- **WHEN** a job with title "Senior Go Developer", company "Acme", and a
  description is indexed
- **THEN** the `jobs` index holds one document keyed by that job's `id` whose
  searchable text includes the title, company, and description

#### Scenario: Unenriched job is still indexed with its parsed geography

- **WHEN** a job with no enrichment but location `Remote - USA` is indexed
- **THEN** the document is present and matchable by its text, with its
  enrichment-derived facets absent or empty and its top-level `regions`/
  `countries` carrying the parsed geography

#### Scenario: Geography is filterable via the top-level regions facet

- **WHEN** a job whose unioned geography includes `eu` is indexed
- **THEN** it is returned by a filter on `regions = "eu"`

#### Scenario: Document carries the effective posting date as an epoch

- **WHEN** a job whose effective posting date is a given instant is indexed
- **THEN** its document carries `posted_ts` equal to that instant in unix
  seconds, and a job with a null or future `posted_at` carries the `created_at`
  instant instead — matching its display `posted_at`

#### Scenario: posted_ts is filterable but not in the public job shape

- **WHEN** a job document is indexed and the same job is read through a public
  job endpoint
- **THEN** the document is filterable by a `posted_ts` numeric range, while the
  public job wire shape does not include a `posted_ts` field

### Requirement: Public job search endpoint

The system SHALL expose `GET /api/v1/jobs/search` as a public (unauthenticated)
endpoint. It SHALL accept a free-text query `q`, facet filters matching the
index's filterable attributes, an optional sort, an optional semantic ratio, and
`limit`/`offset` pagination. Facet filters SHALL include `regions` (the geography
facet) and SHALL NOT include the removed raw `remote` filter. The response SHALL
use the standard list envelope `{"data": [...], "meta": {...}}`, where `data` is
the matched job documents and `meta` carries at least the estimated total hit
count and the applied `limit`/`offset`. The existing `GET /api/v1/jobs` list
endpoint SHALL be unchanged.

The endpoint SHALL additionally accept a `posted_within_days` parameter. When it
is a positive integer `N`, the search SHALL be restricted to jobs whose
`posted_ts` is at or after `now - N*86400` (i.e. posted within the last `N`
days), where `now` is the time the request is served. When the parameter is
absent, empty, zero, negative, or not a valid integer, it SHALL impose no date
restriction. The filter SHALL compose with the other facet filters (AND).

Each result SHALL identify its job by `public_slug` and SHALL NOT include the
internal numeric `id`, consistent with the public-identity contract used by the
other public job reads.

#### Scenario: Keyword query returns matches

- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /api/v1/jobs/search?q=golang`
- **THEN** the response is `{"data": [...], "meta": {...}}` with jobs matching
  "golang" in `data` and the estimated total and pagination in `meta`

#### Scenario: Faceted filtering by region

- **WHEN** a client requests
  `GET /api/v1/jobs/search?q=engineer&seniority=senior&regions=eu`
- **THEN** only jobs whose facets satisfy seniority=senior AND whose top-level
  `regions` include `eu` are returned

#### Scenario: Empty query browses with filters

- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /api/v1/jobs/search` with filters but no `q`
- **THEN** the filtered jobs are returned ranked by the index defaults

#### Scenario: Pagination is reflected in meta

- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /api/v1/jobs/search?q=go&limit=10&offset=20`
- **THEN** at most 10 documents are returned and `meta` reports the applied
  `limit` 10 and `offset` 20 alongside the estimated total

#### Scenario: Results identify jobs by public slug, not internal id

- **WHEN** a job is returned by `GET /api/v1/jobs/search`
- **THEN** the result carries the job's `public_slug` and omits the internal
  numeric `id`

#### Scenario: Freshness filter restricts to recent postings

- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /api/v1/jobs/search?posted_within_days=7`
- **THEN** only jobs whose effective posting date is within the last 7 days are
  returned

#### Scenario: Invalid freshness value imposes no restriction

- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /api/v1/jobs/search` with `posted_within_days`
  absent, zero, negative, or non-numeric
- **THEN** the result is not restricted by posting date
